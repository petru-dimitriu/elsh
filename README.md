# English-Language Study Helper
A simple application written in AutoHotkey designed to help those who study idioms, phrasal verbs, words, to rehearse by matching words, etc with their explanations or the gapped phrase which best suits them, from a small list.
## Overview
Quite straightforward to use. Files with the pairs to match are kept in the `files` subdirectory. Each file contains pairs of matching items in the form `first!second`.
<br> I have provided some exercise files for immediate use.
## Running and compiling
You may run the app by running the `elsh.ahk` script, provided that you have the latest version of AutoHotkey, but it should also run on older versions.

The script can be turned into an exe capable of running under Windows with no prerequisites using AHK's converter.

## Limitations
* Sometimes the answer is ridiculously obvious.
* No companion app to create or edit pair files.
